# Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

# Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries. For audio processing, 
# librosa and soundfile are commonly used. Install them using pip if you haven't already:

# pip install librosa soundfile

# Step 2: Load Your Audio Files
# You can use librosa or soundfile to load an audio file. 
# librosa is particularly useful as it automatically converts the sample rate to 22,050 Hz, 
# which is a common default. However, ensure to check the model documentation for the expected sample rate.

import librosa

audio_file_path = 'path/to/your/audio.wav'
audio, sr = librosa.load(audio_file_path, sr=16000)  # Load an audio file as a floating point time series. Adjust `sr` (sample rate) as needed.

# Step 3: Audio Length Normalization

# Some models expect the audio input to have a fixed length. You might need to either pad short audio files or trim long ones.

import numpy as np

max_length = 16000 * 10  # For example, 10 seconds long
if len(audio) > max_length:
    audio = audio[:max_length]
else:
    padding = max_length - len(audio)
    offset = padding // 2
    audio = np.pad(audio, (offset, padding - offset), 'constant')

# Step 4: Feature Extraction
# Many audio models work not with raw audio waveforms but with features extracted from the audio, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, or Mel-spectrograms.

mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(audio, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)

# Or for a Mel-spectrogram:


import librosa.display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

S = librosa.feature.melspectrogram(y=audio, sr=sr)
S_DB = librosa.power_to_db(S, ref=np.max)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
librosa.display.specshow(S_DB, sr=sr, x_axis='time', y_axis='mel')
plt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')
plt.title('Mel-frequency spectrogram')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Step 5: Data Augmentation (Optional)
# Data augmentation can improve model robustness by artificially increasing the diversity of your training set. Common audio augmentations include adding noise, changing pitch, and varying speed.


# Adding white noise
noise_amp = 0.05*np.random.uniform()*np.amax(audio)
audio = audio + noise_amp*np.random.normal(size=audio.shape[0])

# Step 6: Batch Preparation
# Prepare your data in batches, especially if you're working with large datasets. This often involves creating a custom data loader if you're using a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.

# Step 7: Check Model-Specific Preprocessing
# Before proceeding, it's crucial to check the documentation of the specific Hugging Face model you're planning to fine-tune. Each model may require specific preprocessing steps or input formats. Hugging Face provides utility functions and classes to help with this preprocessing.

# Final Notes
# The steps outlined above provide a general approach to preparing audio data for model fine-tuning. 
# Depending on the complexity of your task and the specific requirements of the pretrained model, 
# you may need to adjust or add to these steps. Always refer to the official documentation of the
# libraries and models you're working with for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
