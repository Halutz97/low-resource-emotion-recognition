# Step 1: Modify the Model
# You need to create a new model class or modify the existing classification head. 
# Assuming you're starting with the Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification, hereâ€™s how you could adjust it:

from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification, Wav2Vec2Config

# Load the model configuration
config = Wav2Vec2Config.from_pretrained('facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h', 
                                        problem_type="regression",
                                        num_labels=2)  # Set num_labels to 2 for two regression outputs

# Create the model
model = Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification(config)

# Step 2: Adjust the Loss Function
# You need to change the loss function to something suitable for regression:

import torch.nn as MSELoss

# Loss function
loss_function = MSELoss()

# Step 3: Training Adjustments
# Adjust your training loop to handle regression labels and loss calculation. 
# Ensure that your labels are continuous values and not classes.

# Example training loop adjustment
model.train()
for batch in train_dataloader:
    inputs = batch["input_values"].to(device)
    labels = batch["labels"].to(device)  # Labels should be continuous values

    outputs = model(inputs).logits
    loss = loss_function(outputs, labels)

    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()


# Step 4: Adjust Evaluation Metrics
# Replace classification metrics with regression metrics:

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Assuming you have `predictions` and `true_values`
mse = mean_squared_error(true_values, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(true_values, predictions)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R^2 Score: {r2}")

# By making these adjustments, you can effectively reconfigure your Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification model
#  for a regression task, outputting two continuous values as required.
